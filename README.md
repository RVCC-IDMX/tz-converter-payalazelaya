# Time Zone Converter

## How the Converter Works

The converter allows a user to find the timezones of various locations across the globe through arguments passed in the command line terminal. The program sets the timezone to be the default of "America/New_York." If an argument is passed, the user can find the timezone of any location but if no argument is passed, a usage message is printed in the console of the terminal.
